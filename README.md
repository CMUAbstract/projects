# Projects by Abstract group at Carnegie Mellon University

This wiki-like bootstrap repository contains the getting-started information
for developers who would like to make use of the software and hardware tools we
release. For projects that span multiple repositories (SW, HW, example
applications, etc), this repository is the starting point with guides and
structured links to the repositories within the flat repository pool hosted on
GitHub. Follow the link for each project to see a synopsis and a quick-start
guide.

## Programming models and runtimes for intermittently-powered hardware

* [Alpaca](Alpaca.md): a checkpoint-less programming model with compiler support for intermittent programming
* [Chain](Chain.md): a task-based programming model and runtime for intermittent programming
* [Capybara](Capybara.md): hardware and firmware for reconfigurable energy storage

## Tools

* [EDB](EDB.md): an energy-interference-free debugger for energy-harvesting devices

## Case-studies and applications

* [EDBsat](EDBsat.md): a solar-powered nano-satellite for sensing with a built-in profiler
